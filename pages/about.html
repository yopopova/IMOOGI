                <p>Imoogi is a dragon from Korean mythology that resembles a huge water snake. The purpose in life of
                    every Imoogi is to get wings to become a real dragon. To accomplish this goal of his, he must
                    capture Yeouiju - a crystal sphere that falls from the heavens.</p>

                <p>Like Imoogi, we believe only the real things
                    in life deserve our attention and make us feel
                    fully.</p>

                <p>That's why we created Imoogi Korean Restaurant. Because for us
                    food is not just lunch or dinner for the day. It is a ritual.
                    It connects us. It makes us share and explore worlds,
                    to discover that we are not so different even though we live
                    in different parts of the world.</p>

                <p>Thanks to Korean traditional recipes
                    we are pleased to accompany each of our guests
                    to his culinary journey through South Korea.</p>
