        <div id="content">
            <p>Imoogi is a dragon from Korean mythology that resembles a huge water snake. The purpose in life of every Imoogi is to get wings to become a real dragon. To accomplish this goal of his, he must capture Yeouiju - a crystal sphere that falls from the heavens.</p>
            <p>Like Imoogi, we believe only the real things in life deserve our attention and make us feel fully. That's why we created IMOOGI Korean restaurant. Because for us food is not just lunch or dinner for the day. It is a ritual. It connects us. It makes us share and explore worlds, to discover that we are not so different even though we live in different parts of the world.</p>
            <p>Thanks to Korean traditional recipes we are pleased to accompany each of our guests to his culinary journey through South Korea.</p>
